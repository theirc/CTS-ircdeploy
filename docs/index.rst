=========================================

This project contains the deployment architecture used by the 
`International Rescue Committee (IRC)`_ for the `CTS`_ project. While this 
repository is specific to IRC's instance of CTS, the architecture may be used 
as an example or reference for alternative deployments. To explore other open
source IRC projects, please see IRC's `GitHub`_ account.

The purpose of this documentation is to help system administrators
deploy and maintain CTS. A certain level of knowledge of Linux is
assumed.
